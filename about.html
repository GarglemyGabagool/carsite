                <h2>A little about me and my background,</h2>
                <p>My name's Nick, I was born on 1995 in Birmingham, AL. I grew up in Center Point which is an awful
                    little run down town north East of Birmingham, past Roebuck. I've loved tech and computers my whole
                    life, I practically
                    grew up on them. I even learned how to build them when I was around 12 years old.</p>
                <p>My first real job was working at Publix Supermarkets, where I quickly got up to Assistant Department
                    Manager, before realizing that the environment was not what I really wanted to live with for the
                    rest of my life. So I ended up looking into ways to move careers to something closer to my natural
                    tech interests.</p>
