        <h1>About Me - </h1>
        <h2>Hi, my name is Nicholas Henderson</h2>
        <p>
            I've relatively recently taken to learning programming, starting with full stack web development.
            I made this whole website myself, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, EJS, and so on.
            My goal is to shift from working in retail towards working in tech which has always been a huge passion of
            mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up playing and modding video games, beginnning with an old Volition game called FreeSpace 2, which threw me down the tech rabbit hole
